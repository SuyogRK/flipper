An alternative take on search on fanfiction.net

FFSSE is written in Qt5, partially with QML, and is supposed to be built with QBS build system.
The database format is SQLITE3.

Please note that to run this application SQLITE3 version of qt libraries must match the one built into QT you are building with.
Adjust contents of your sqlite folder accordingly after the clone.
The currently present files are for Qt 5.10 and SQLITE 3.20.1
